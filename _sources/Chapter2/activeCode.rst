.. activecode:: vars_types_a1
   :language: cpp

   Fix the code below so that it runs without errors.  Hint: you might
   need to change the names of some variables.
   ~~~~
   int main () {
       char true = 'T';
       char false = 'F';
       cout << true << " is short for true. ";
       cout << false << " is short for false." << endl;

       // Do not modify anything below.
       return 0;
   }


.. activecode:: vars_types_a2
   :language: cpp

   Fix the code below so that it prints "I drive a 2014 Buick Regal".
   ~~~~
   int main () {
       string make;
       make = "Buick"

       string model = "Regal";

       string year = 2014;

       cout << "I drive a";  cout << " ";
       cout << year << model << make << endl.
   }


.. activecode:: vars_types_a3
   :language: cpp

   Fix the code below so that it prints "Cady scored .90 on the exam."
   ~~~~
   int main() {
       int Cady = (3 * 5) * 6 / 100;

   }


.. activecode:: vars_types_a4
   :language: cpp

   Finish the code below so that it returns the correct volume of a sphere.  Hint: 
   think about what happens when you use integer division.
   ~~~~
   int main () {
       int radius = 5;

       // Complete the line below.
       volume = ;

       // Do not modify anything below.
       cout << volume;
   }


.. activecode:: vars_types_a5
   :language: cpp

   Finish the code below so that assigns ``a`` its correct value of ``'a'``.  Hint:
   use character operations!
   ~~~~
   int main () {
       char a = 's';

       // Complete the line below.
       a = ;

       // Do not modify anything below.
       cout << a;
   }


.. activecode:: vars_types_a6
   :language: cpp

   Write code that assigns "apples" to oranges, and "oranges" to apples,
   then swaps their values.  YOU MAY NOT HARDCODE YOUR SOLUTION.
   ~~~~
   int main () {

   }


.. activecode:: vars_types_a7
   :language: cpp

   Write code that prints "Eat", "More", and "Chicken" on 3 consecutive lines.

   int main () {

   }


.. activecode:: vars_types_a9
   :language: cpp

   You have about three hours and fifteen minutes of homework to do today.  Rather
   than starting it right away, you choose to procrastinate by calculating how many
   seconds you'll be spending on your work.  Convert the time to seconds and store the
   result in ``seconds``.
   ~~~~
   int main () {

   }


.. activecode:: vars_types_a10
   :language: cpp

   Write code that calculates and prints the average of a and b if a = 3.14,
