Definitions and Uses
--------------------

Pulling together all the code fragments from the previous section, the
whole program looks like this:

::

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    void newLine () {
      cout << endl;
    }

    void threeLine () {
      newLine ();  newLine ();  newLine ();
    }

    int main () {
      cout << "First Line." << endl;
      threeLine ();
      cout << "Second Line." << endl;
      return 0;
    }

This program contains three function definitions: ``newLine``, ``threeLine``,
and ``main``.

Inside the definition of ``main``, there is a statement that uses or calls
``threeLine``. Similarly, ``threeLine`` calls ``newLine`` three times. Notice that
the definition of each function appears above the place where it is
used.

This is necessary in C++; the definition of a function must appear
before (above) the first use of the function. You should try compiling
this program with the functions in a different order and see what error
messages you get.


.. fillintheblank:: defns_uses_1

   The function definition must be written |blank| the first use of the function.

.. activecode:: defns_uses_2
   :language: cpp
   :caption: The newBorder Function

   Call the function called newBorder in your main function. This adds a 
   divider in between sections of your output.
   ~~~~
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   void newBorder () {
       cout << "..................." << endl;
   }

   int main () {
       cout << "First Line." << endl;
       //Call your function here!
       cout << "Second Line." << endl;
       return 0;
   }


.. parsonsprob:: defns_uses_3
   :adaptive:

   Construct a block of code that correctly defines a the addTwo function.
   -----
   int addTwo(int x) {

   int addTwo(int x); #distractor

   int addTwo(int x) #distractor

    int new = x + 2;

    return new;

    return x; #distractor

   }
