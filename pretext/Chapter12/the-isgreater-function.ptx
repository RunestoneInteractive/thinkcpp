  <title>The <c>isGreater</c> function</title>
  <p>For basic types like <c>int</c> and <c>double</c>, there are comparison operators that compare values
    and determine when one is greater or less than another. These operators (<c>&lt;</c> and <c>&gt;</c> and
    the others) don't work for user-defined types. Just as we did for the <c>==</c> operator, we will
    write a comparison function that plays the role of the <c>&gt;</c> operator. Later, we will use this
    function to sort a deck of cards.</p>
  <p>Some sets are totally ordered, which means that you can compare any two elements and tell which
    is bigger. For example, the integers and the floating-point numbers are totally ordered. Some
    sets are unordered, which means that there is no meaningful way to say that one element is
    bigger than another. For example, the fruits are unordered, which is why we cannot compare
    apples and oranges. As another example, the <c>bool</c> type is unordered; we cannot say that <c>true</c>
    is greater than <c>false</c>.</p>
  <p>The set of playing cards is partially ordered, which means that
    sometimes we can compare cards and sometimes not. For example, I know
    that the 3 of Clubs is higher than the 2 of Clubs because it has higher
    rank, and the 3 of Diamonds is higher than the 3 of Clubs because it has
    higher suit. But which is better, the 3 of Clubs or the 2 of Diamonds?
    One has a higher rank, but the other has a higher suit.</p>
  <p>In order to make cards comparable, we have to decide which is more
    important, rank or suit. To be honest, the choice is completely
    arbitrary. For the sake of choosing, I will say that suit is more
    important, because when you buy a new deck of cards, it comes sorted
    with all the Clubs together, followed by all the Diamonds, and so on.</p>
  <p>With that decided, we can write <c>isGreater</c>. Again, the arguments (two <c>Card</c>s) and the return
    type (boolean) are obvious, and again we have to choose between a member function and a
    nonmember function. This time, the arguments are not symmetric. It matters whether we want to
    know <q>Is A greater than B?</q> or <q>Is B greater than A?</q> Therefore I think it makes more
    sense to write <c>isGreater</c> as a member function:</p>
  <program>bool Card::isGreater(const Card&amp; c2) const {
  // first check the suits
  if (suit &gt; c2.suit) return true;
  if (suit &lt; c2.suit) return false;

  // if the suits are equal, check the ranks
  if (rank &gt; c2.rank) return true;
  if (rank &lt; c2.rank) return false;

  // if the ranks are also equal, return false
  return false;
}</program>
  <p>Then when we invoke it, it is obvious from the syntax which of the two
    possible questions we are asking:</p>
  <program>Card card1 (2, 10);
Card card2 (2, 4);

if (card1.isGreater (card2)) {
  card1.print();
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;is greater than&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
  card2.print();
}</program>
  <p>You can almost read it like English: <q>If card1 isGreater card2 â€¦</q> The output of
    this program is</p>
  <console><output>10 of Hearts
is greater than
4 of Hearts</output></console>
  <p>According to <c>isGreater</c>, aces are less than deuces (2s). As an exercise, fix it so that aces are
    ranked higher than Kings, as they are in most card games.</p>
