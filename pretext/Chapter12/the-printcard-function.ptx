  <title>The <c>printCard</c> function</title>
  <p>When you create a new type, the first step is usually to declare the
    instance variables and write constructors. The second step is often to
    write a function that prints the object in human-readable form.</p>
  <p>In the case of <c>Card</c> objects, <q>human-readable</q> means that we have to map the internal
    representation of the rank and suit onto words. A natural way to do that is with a vector of <c>string</c>s.
    You can create a vector of <c>string</c>s the same way you create an vector of other types:</p>
  <program>
vector&lt;string&gt; suits(4);
</program>
  <p>Of course, in order to use <c>vector</c>s and <c>string</c>s, you will have to include the header files for
    both.</p>
  <p>To initialize the elements of the vector, we can use a series of
    assignment statements.</p>
  <program>suits[0] = &quot;Clubs&quot;;
suits[1] = &quot;Diamonds&quot;;
suits[2] = &quot;Hearts&quot;;
suits[3] = &quot;Spades&quot;;</program>
  <p>A state diagram for this vector looks like this:</p>
  <p>We can build a similar vector to decode the ranks. Then we can select the appropriate elements
    using the <c>suit</c> and <c>rank</c> as indices. Finally, we can write a function called <c>print</c> that
    outputs the card on which it is invoked:</p>
  <program>void Card::print() const {
  vector&lt;string&gt; suits(4);
  suits[0] = &quot;Clubs&quot;;
  suits[1] = &quot;Diamonds&quot;;
  suits[2] = &quot;Hearts&quot;;
  suits[3] = &quot;Spades&quot;;

  vector&lt;string&gt; ranks(14);
  ranks[1] = &quot;Ace&quot;;
  ranks[2] = &quot;2&quot;;
  ranks[3] = &quot;3&quot;;
  ranks[4] = &quot;4&quot;;
  ranks[5] = &quot;5&quot;;
  ranks[6] = &quot;6&quot;;
  ranks[7] = &quot;7&quot;;
  ranks[8] = &quot;8&quot;;
  ranks[9] = &quot;9&quot;;
  ranks[10] = &quot;10&quot;;
  ranks[11] = &quot;Jack&quot;;
  ranks[12] = &quot;Queen&quot;;
  ranks[13] = &quot;King&quot;;

  cout &lt;&lt; ranks[rank] &lt;&lt; &quot; of &quot; &lt;&lt; suits[suit] &lt;&lt; endl;
}</program>
  <p>The expression <c>suits[suit]</c> means <q>use the instance variable <c>suit</c> from the current object as an
    index into the vector named <c>suits</c>, and select the appropriate string.</q></p>
  <p>Because <c>print</c> is a <c>Card</c> member function, it can refer to the instance variables of the
    current object implicitly (without having to use dot notation to specify the object). The output
    of this code</p>
  <program>Card card (1, 11);
card.print();</program>
  <p>is <c>Jack of Diamonds</c>.</p>

      <p>This active code uses the <c>Card::print()</c> function. Feel free to modify the values that <c>card</c> is

  <p>You might notice that we are not using the zeroeth element of the <c>ranks</c> vector. That's
    because the only valid ranks are 1â€“13. By leaving an unused element at the beginning of
    the vector, we get an encoding where 2 maps to <q>2</q>, 3 maps to <q>3</q>, etc. From the point
    of view of the user, it doesn't matter what the encoding is, since all input and output uses
    human-readable formats. On the other hand, it is often helpful for the programmer if the
    mappings are easy to remember.</p>
