            <p>An operator that works on integers and yields the remainder when one
            number is divided by another. In C++ it is denoted with a percent
            sign (%).</p>

            <title>infinite recursion</title>
            <p>A function that calls itself recursively without every reaching the
            base case. Eventually an infinite recursion will cause a run-time
            error.</p>
