  <title>Composition</title>
  <p>So far we have looked at the elements of a programming
            language&#x2014;variables, expressions, and statements&#x2014;in isolation, without
            talking about how to combine them.</p>
  <p>One of the most useful features of programming languages is their
            ability to take small building blocks and <term>compose</term> them. For example,
            we know how to multiply integers and we know how to output values; it
            turns out we can do both at the same time:</p>
  <listing label="composition_AC_1">
    <title>
      This program performs multiplication and prints the result.
    </title>
    <program xml:id="composition_AC_1_editor" interactive="activecode" line-numbers="yes">
      <code><![CDATA[
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << 17 * 3;
}
        ]]></code>
    </program>
  </listing>
  <p>Actually, I shouldn't say <q>at the same time,</q> since in reality the
            multiplication has to happen before the output, but the point is that
            any expression, involving numbers, characters, and variables, can be
            used inside an output statement. We've already seen one example:</p>
  <listing label="composition_AC_2">
    <title>
      This program performs a calculation involving variables and prints the result at the same time.
    </title>
    <program xml:id="composition_AC_2_editor" interactive="activecode" line-numbers="yes">
      <code><![CDATA[
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int hour = 7;
    int minute = 1;
    cout << hour * 60 + minute << endl;
}
        ]]></code>
    </program>
  </listing>
  <p>You can also put arbitrary expressions on the right-hand side of an
            assignment statement:</p>
  <listing label="composition_AC_3">
    <title>
      This program performs a calculation involving variables and assigns the result to a variable.
    </title>
    <program xml:id="composition_AC_3_editor" interactive="activecode" line-numbers="yes">
      <code><![CDATA[
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int minute = 3;
    int percentage;
    percentage = (minute * 100) / 60;
    cout << percentage;
}
        ]]></code>
    </program>
  </listing>
  <p>This ability may not seem so impressive now, but we will see other
            examples where composition makes it possible to express complex
            computations neatly and concisely.</p>
  <warning>
    <p>There are limits on where you can use certain expressions; most
                notably, the left-hand side of an assignment statement has to be a
                <em>variable</em> name, not an expression.</p>
  </warning>
  <p>That's because the left side indicates the storage location where the
            result will go. Expressions do not represent storage locations, only
            values. So the following is illegal: <c>minute + 1 = hour;</c>.</p>

          The == operator checks if the left side EQUALS the right side.  It is not the correct operator here.

          pets has already been declared as an int.  Also, the == operator is not the proper choice here.
