  <title>Which is best?</title>
  <p>Anything that can be done with modifiers and fill-in functions can also be done with pure
    functions. In fact, there are programming languages, called <term>functional</term> programming
    languages, that only allow pure functions. Some programmers believe that programs that use pure
    functions are faster to develop and less error-prone than programs that use modifiers.
    Nevertheless, there are times when modifiers are convenient, and cases where functional programs
    are less efficient.</p>
  <p>In general, I recommend that you write pure functions whenever it is
    reasonable to do so, and resort to modifiers only if there is a
    compelling advantage. This approach might be called a functional
    programming style.</p>
