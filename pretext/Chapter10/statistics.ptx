  <title>Statistics</title>
  <p>The numbers generated by <c>random</c> are supposed to be distributed uniformly. That means that each
    value in the range should be equally likely. If we count the number of times each value appears,
    it should be roughly the same for all values, provided that we generate a large number of
    values.</p>
  <p>In the next few sections, we will write programs that generate a
    sequence of random numbers and check whether this property holds true.</p>
