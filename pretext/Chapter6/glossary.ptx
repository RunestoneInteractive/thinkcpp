            <title>loop</title>
            <p>A statement that executes repeatedly while a condition is true or
            until some condition is satisfied.</p>
        </gi>
        <gi>
            <title>infinite loop</title>
            <p>A loop whose condition is always true.</p>
        </gi>
        <gi>
            <title>body</title>
            <p>The statements inside the loop.</p>
        </gi>
        <gi>
            <title>iteration</title>
            <p>One pass through (execution of) the body of the loop, including the
            evaluation of the condition.</p>
        </gi>
        <gi>
            <title>tab</title>
            <p>A special character, written as <c>\t</c> in C++, that causes the cursor to move to the next
            tab stop on the current line.</p>
        </gi>
        <gi>
            <title>encapsulate</title>
            <p>To divide a large complex program into components (like functions)
            and isolate the components from each other (for example, by using
            local variables).</p>
        </gi>
        <gi>
            <title>local variable</title>
            <p>A variable that is declared inside a function and that exists only
            within that function. Local variables cannot be accessed from outside
            their home function, and do not interfere with any other functions.</p>
        </gi>
        <gi>
            <title>generalize</title>
            <p>To replace something unnecessarily specific (like a constant value)
            with something appropriately general (like a variable or parameter).
            Generalization makes code more versatile, more likely to be reused,
            and sometimes even easier to write.</p>
        </gi>
        <gi>
            <title>development plan</title>
            <p>A process for developing a program. In this chapter, I demonstrated a
            style of development based on developing code to do simple, specific
            things, and then encapsulating and generalizing.</p>
