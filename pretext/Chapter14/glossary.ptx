            <p>In general use, a class is a user-defined type with member functions.
            In C++, a class is a structure with private instance variables.</p>

            <title>invariant:</title>
            <p>A condition, usually pertaining to an object, that should be true at
            all times in client code, and that should be maintained by all member
            functions.</p>

            <title>precondition:</title>
            <p>A condition that is assumed to be true at the beginning of a
            function. If the precondition is not true, the function may not work.
            It is often a good idea for functions to check their preconditions,
            if possible.</p>
