  <title>What is a class?</title>
  <p>In most object-oriented programming languages, a <term>class</term> is a
            user-defined type that includes a set of functions. As we have seen,
            structures in C++ meet the general definition of a class.</p>
  <p>But there is another feature in C++ that also meets this definition;
            confusingly, it is called a <c>class</c>. In C++, a class is just a
            structure whose instance variables are private by default. For example,
            I could have written the <c>Card</c> definition:</p>
  <pre>class Card
{
  int suit, rank;

public:
  Card ();
  Card (int s, int r);

  int getRank () const { return rank; }
  int getSuit () const { return suit; }
  int setRank (int r) { rank = r; }
  int setSuit (int s) { suit = s; }
};</pre>
  <p>I replaced the word <c>struct</c> with the word <c>class</c> and removed the
            <c>private:</c> label. This result of the two definitions is exactly the
            same.</p>
  <p>In fact, anything that can be written as a <c>struct</c> can also be
            written as a <c>class</c>, just by adding or removing labels. There is no
            real reason to choose one over the other, except that as a stylistic
            choice, most C++ programmers use <c>class</c>.</p>
  <p>Also, it is common to refer to all user-defined types in C++ as
            <q>classes,</q> regardless of whether they are defined as a <c>struct</c> or a
            <c>class</c>.</p>
